# Plagiarism Detection

This project detects plagiarism by comparing a test document to a set of reference documents using NLP and machine learning techniques. It calculates similarity using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity to identify plagiarized content.

## Key Features

- **Preprocessing**: Tokenizes, removes stopwords, and stems text.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Transforms text into numerical representations based on term importance.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between the test document and reference documents.
- **Plagiarism Detection**: Identifies documents with similarity scores above a set threshold, indicating potential plagiarism.
